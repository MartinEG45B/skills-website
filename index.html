      <p class=" article">My name is Euan Martin. I am a 20-year-old first-year computer science student at
        Staffordshire University. I was born in Kagoshima in Japan on the 15th of November 1999. I have a twin brother.
        My hobbies are playing games, playing basketball, and watching anime. My favorite food is sushi. I'm motivated,
        passionate and interested in computer science, especially software development. This page gives more details
        about me, so please read below.</p>

          <p>I am an international student at Staffordshire University. I am from Japan. The reason for
            coming to a university in the United Kingdom is connected with my father. </p>
          <p>He was British, but sadly passed
            away when I was 14 years old. I regretted not leaning English from him and not knowing more about his home
            country when he died, and ever since I wanted to go to a university in the United Kingdom. Moreover, because
            I
            was interested in Computer Science and wanted to improve my English skills, in order to accomplish both I
            thought that the best way of accomplishing both is going to a university that provides a Computer Science
            course in the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p class="article">I have 3 goals as a first-year Computer Science student at Staffordshire University.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Build a solid understanding of Computer Science concepts
              <p class="ol">I reckon building a solid understanding of Computer Science concepts in my first-year is
                essential. In order to achieve this, I will ask questions actively where I don't understand, I will do
                research about it and practise it in my own time. I believe that this will help me in my second year
                significantly. I think lacking fundamentals will be a big obstacle in order to be successful.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>Get used to group works
              <p class="ol">Getting used to working in groups is crucial for my career. It is not just about being good
                at programming. I do not have that much experience in group working projects and I am lacking
                communication skills, which are the most important things in group work. I want to acquire this skill
                through my group work projects at University which directly contributes to my career job.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Develop my interest in programming outside of University
              <p class="ol">To develop my programming skills and get proficient with it, it is not enough just following
                lectures and tutorial tasks. I reckon to work on my programming skills outside of University and working
                on personal projects are the most efficient way of developing my programming skills. Therefore, I want
                to create a habit of practising programming skills regularly and I want to try working on personal
                projects, which interests me.</p>
