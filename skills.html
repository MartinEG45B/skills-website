      <p>In web development, there are three fundamental skills used to make a fascinating website. HTML (Hyper
        Hypertext
        Markup
        Language) as a <strong>content layer</strong> (where the content of the page lives and gives the structure),
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) as a <strong>presentation layer</strong> (where styles are added to state how HTML
        content
        is presented), and
        ECMAScript also known as JavaScript as a <strong>behaviour layer</strong> (where we can change how the page
        behaves
        or
        interact with users). This page explains what CSS and ECMAScript
        are with showing example pages.</p>

        <h2 id="cssSection" class="skillsH2">CSS</h2>
        <p class="skillsArticleP">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It acts as a presentation layer on a website
          which means it adds styles to the HTML and changes how the HTML will be presented to users. There are three
          ways of adding CSS to an HTML
          file, inline CSS (way of adding CSS to specific tags using style attribute), internal CSS (way of adding CSS
          inside &lt;head&gt; tag using &lt;style&gt; tag), and external CSS (way of adding CSS by linking a external
          CSS
          file to an HTML file). The best way of adding CSS is external CSS since the CSS is separated from the HTML
          file, whereas inline CSS and internal CSS live inside the HTML file which makes the HTML cluttered and makes
          the
          size
          of the HTML file big. External CSS makes it easier to maintain the HTML file and the CSS file since it is
          separated and a single
          CSS file can be linked to multiple webpages, hence efficient.</p>
        <p class="skillsArticleP">I'll show the power of CSS by demonstrating how CSS can apply completely different
          styles to an exact same HTML file in the following sections.</p>

              1 (Software Development, Data Science, and Machine Learning to Machine
              Learning, Software Development, and Data Science). The navigation bar's content is aligned

        <h2 class="skillsH2">ECMAScript</h2>
        <p class="skillsArticleP">ECMAScript stands for European Computer Manufacturer's Association. ECMAScript is also
          known as JavaScript and it is called interchangeably, but strictly speaking, ECMAScript is the standard and
          JavaScript is the language (created by Brendan Eich in 10 days) which implements ECMAScript standard. The
          current
          latest version of ECMAScript is ECMAScript 2020, but ECMAScript 2017 is the current widely-supported standard.
          ECMAScript (JavaScript) acts as a behaviour layer on a website which means it changes how the page behaves or
          interacts with users i.e. it adds interactivity. Same as CSS it is better to keep JavaScript separate from the
          HTML file for efficiency, maintainability and to make the website work even if the user can't load or run the
          JavaScript file. JavaScript file is added to the last part of the body (before the &lt;/body&gt; tag) using
          &lt;script&gt; tag. The reason for adding it to the last part of the body is because when a browser loads a
          JavaScript file it stops to load other files. This will make the website look slow to load. Another reason is
          that JavaScript file on a website requires an HTML file, therefore it is better to load the HTML file before
          the
          Javascript file.

              other options. Keep an eye on all interactions with each element. It will update the user's order
              concurrently. This is done by using event listeners. Also, when the "Add to favourites" button is clicked,
              it will record the current order and by clicking on the "Order favourite" button it will automatically
              fill out the form. This is done by using local storage. The feature that when you order 10 drinks the 10th
              drink will be free is also accomplished by using local storage. The user's favourite drink and the number
              of drinks purchased will not be erased even if the window or tab is closed.
